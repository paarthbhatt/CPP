    "# Design a search query autocomplete system for a search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The users will input a sentence ( which may have multiple words and ends with special character '#').\n",
    "\n",
    "### For each character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 previously entered and most frequently queried sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Here are the specific rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The frequency for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.\n",
    "### The returned top 3 sentences should be sorted by frequency (The first is the most frequent).  If several sentences have the same frequency, you need to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).\n",
    "### If less than 3 valid sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.\n",
    "### When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "# Your job is to implement the methods of the AutoCompleteSystem:\n",
    "\n",
    "### AutoCompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times): This is the constructor. The input is previously used data. Sentences is a string array consists of previously typed sentences. Times is the corresponding times a sentence has been typed. Your system should record these historical sentences.\n",
    "### Now, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will provide the next character the user types:\n",
    "\n",
    "### String[] input(char c): The input c is the next character typed by the user. The character will only be lower-case letters ('a' to 'z'), blank space (' ') or a special character ('#'). Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded in your system. The output an array will be the top 3 historical sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Operation:\n",
    "AutoCompleteSystem([\"i love you\", \"island\",\n",
    "\"ironman\", \"i love geeksforgeeks\"], [5,3,2,2])\n",
    "\n",
    "The system have already tracked down the \n",
    "following sentences and their corresponding \n",
    "times: \n",
    "\"i love you\" : 5 times \n",
    "\"island\" : 3 times \n",
    "\"ironman\" : 2 times \n",
    "\"i love geeksforgeeks\" : 2 times \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the user begins another search: \n",
    "\n",
    "Operation: input('i') \n",
    "Output: \n",
    "[\"i love you\", \"island\",\"i love \n",
    "                       geeksforgeeks\"] \n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "There are four sentences that have prefix \n",
    "\"i\". Among them, \"ironman\" and \"i love \n",
    "geeksforgeeks\" have same frequency. Since \n",
    "' ' has ASCII code 32 and 'r' has ASCII code\n",
    " 114, \"i love geeksforgeeks\" should be in \n",
    "front of \"ironman\". Also we only need to \n",
    "output top 3 most frequent sentences, so \n",
    "\"ironman\" will be ignored. \n",
    "\n",
    "Operation: input(' ') \n",
    "Output: [\"i love you\",\"i love geeksforgeeks\"] \n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "There are only two sentences that have prefix \n",
    "\"i \". \n",
    "\n",
    "Operation: input('a') \n",
    "Output: [] \n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "There are no sentences that have prefix \"i a\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Operation: input('#') \n",
    "Output: [] \n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "The user finished the input, the sentence \n",
    "\"i a\" should be saved as a historical \n",
    "sentence in system. And the next input \n",
    "will be counted as a new search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "### You don't need to take inputs or give outputs . You just have to complete the input() method and the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Time Complexity: O(n*max|L|), per input query where n represents the number of historical sentences in the system and L is the maximum length of the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Time Complexity: O(|sentences|), |sentences| represents the total length of all historical sentences in the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The input sentence will always start with a letter and end with '#', and at most one blank space will exist between two words.\n",
    "### The number of complete sentences that to be searched won't exceed 102.\n",
    "### The length of each sentence including those in the historical data and query data won't exceed 102."

    "### Class Overview\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class AutoCompleteSystem:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, sentences, times):\n",
    "        self.history = {}\n",
    "        for sentence, time in zip(sentences, times):\n",

    "        self.max_suggestions = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The constructor takes two parameters:\n",
    "  - `sentences`: List of historical search queries\n",
    "  - `times`: List of how many times each sentence was searched\n",
    "- Creates a `history` dictionary where:\n",
    "  - Keys are sentences\n",
    "  - Values are their frequencies\n",
    "- Initializes `current_query` as empty string to track ongoing user input\n",
    "- Sets `max_suggestions` to 3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Method\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def input(self, c):\n",
    "    if c == '#':\n",
    "        # Handle end of query\n",
    "        if self.current_query:\n",
    "            self.history[self.current_query] = self.history.get(self.current_query, 0) + 1\n",

    "        return []\n",
    "    else:\n",

    "                      if sentence.startswith(self.current_query)]\n",
    "        suggestions.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))\n",
    "        return [sentence for _, sentence in suggestions[:self.max_suggestions]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "1. **End of Query (`#`):**\n",
    "   - Updates frequency of completed query in history\n",
    "   - Resets current query\n",
    "   - Returns empty list\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regular Character Input:**\n",
    "   - Adds character to current query\n",
    "   - Creates list of tuples: `(frequency, sentence)` for matching sentences\n",
    "   - Sorts suggestions by:\n",
    "     - Primary: Frequency (descending) using `-x[0]`\n",
    "     - Secondary: Alphabetical order using `x[1]`\n",
    "   - Returns top 3 matching sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "```python\n",
    "auto = AutoCompleteSystem([\"i love you\", \"island\", \"ironman\"], [5, 3, 2])\n",
    "print(auto.input('i'))  # [\"i love you\", \"island\", \"ironman\"]\n",
    "print(auto.input(' '))  # [\"i love you\"]\n",
    "print(auto.input('#'))  # []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The system efficiently maintains search history and provides real-time suggestions based on user input, following the specified frequency and ASCII-order sorting rules.\n"
